  "pourquoiLocabTexte2": "As is often the case for young parents, we went on vacation with 3/4 of the house in the car: stroller, carrycot, bed, bathtub, nappies, deckchair, and of course, the essentials for a 45-days old baby, a playpen of 1m²!",
  "pourquoiLocabTexte3": "At that time, we had not yet fully understood that a 45-days-old baby doesn't move so much! And for our child, we wanted the best, the most comfortable and the most spacious! And it was at that time, after 8 hours of driving with the little one, in a busy car, that we asked ourselves the question that was going to change our lives: isn't there a rental service for all that? We didn't know it yet, but Loca-b was born!",
